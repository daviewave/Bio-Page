            My name is David Silveira, I recently graduated from the university of Massachusetts Amherst in the Spring of 2021. I graduated with a bachelors of science degree in psychology with a focus on Neuroscience. In college I took several computer science classes working with the programming languages Java, JavaScript, C, and R.

            I am from a small town just outside Boston, Massachusetts called Wilmington. I love to watch and play sports and my favorites are soccer and hockey. I am also super into crypto, more specifically ethereum and the basic attention token. The basic attention token is associated with the Brave Browser and was created by the same person who created JavaScript.
